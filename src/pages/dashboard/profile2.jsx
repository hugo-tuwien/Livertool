Basic statistical measures that describe the distribution of voxel intensities within the region of interest (ROI) in a medical image. 
These features provide information about the intensity values without considering spatial relationships between voxels. 
First order features are derived directly from the histogram of voxel intensities within the ROI.                     
Some of this features are: Mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum...etc.

Quantitative measures that describe the geometric properties and shape characteristics of a two-dimensional region of interest (ROI) within a medical image. 
Unlike their 3D counterparts, these features focus on analyzing structures in a single image slice rather than considering the entire three-dimensional volume.

Set of texture features used in image analysis, specifically designed to capture the distribution of connected regions of pixels with the same intensity level, 
known as "size zones" or "gray-level zones." GLSZM is particularly useful for characterizing the size variations and spatial distribution of homogeneous regions in an image.
Some of this features are: Definition, calculation, small zone emphasis, large zone emphasis... etc.

texture features used in image analysis to characterize the distribution of consecutive pixels with the same intensity level along specific directions in an image. 
These features capture information about the length and frequency of homogeneous runs of pixels in different directions.

texture features used in image analysis to describe the differences in pixel intensities between a pixel and its neighbors.

                    Radiomic features are quantitative parameters extracted from medical images through image processing techniques. These features encompass a variety of descriptors, such as statistical measures, texture patterns, shape characteristics, and spatial relationships within the images. The goal is to derive meaningful information from medical images, aiding in tasks like diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. Radiomic features are often used in conjunction with machine learning to build models that can classify diseases, predict outcomes, and provide insights into tissue characteristics

                    <p>
                    Challenges in radiomics include ensuring the reliability of features, dealing with variations in imaging protocols, and addressing the interpretability and clinical relevance of certain descriptors. Overall, radiomics represents an approach to leverage the wealth of information embedded in medical images for more informed and data-driven medical decision-making.
